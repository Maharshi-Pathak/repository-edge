> :books: Links and changes to reflect the InfluxDB docs (#3)

* Links and changes to reflect the InfluxDB docs

1.  Added link to the InfluxDB add-on
2. Add the link and step to how to create the database from the InfluxDB add-on docs
3. Add the "suggested" names from the InfluxDB
4. Remove the word Grafana from "Grafana InfluxDB database" to avoid confusion that a separate DB need to be created or used

I'm not so familiar with Grafana and InfluxDB but I believe that is the way to set up.

* Add link to add on and new user instructions

1.  Add to the paragraph that the user should first create a database with the link for the addon. 
2. Add the Create a new user for grafana on InfluxDB
3.  _Grafana InfluxDB username_ kept highlight that is not the homeassistant
4.  _Grafana InfluxDB user password_ to highlight that this is the new created user password.

Hopefully is better.

* :shirt: Markdown lint fixes
